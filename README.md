PROJECT NAME: SCHEDULE MAKER

Quick Description:

The program is a storing type of software that stores the schedule input of the user and display it. It is a typical schedule maker which every input (time, day, and subject) and displays it in the graphical user’s interface. The data are placed into a database. Then the program will access to the database when it’s time to display the values in the appropriate labels. If possible, we want to make the program save the schedule into a .csv file so the user can backtrack and recheck the schedules made for the past weeks.
